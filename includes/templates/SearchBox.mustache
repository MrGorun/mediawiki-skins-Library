		{{!	We construct two buttons (for 'go' and 'fulltext' search modes), but only one will be
				visible and actionable at a time (they are overlaid on top of each other in CSS).
				* Browsers will use the 'fulltext' one by default (as it's the first in tree-order),
					which is desirable when they are unable to show search suggestions (either due to being
					broken or having JavaScript turned off).
				* The mediawiki.searchSuggest module, after doing tests for the broken browsers, removes
					the 'fulltext' button and handles 'fulltext' search itself; this will reveal the 'go'
					button and cause it to be used.	!}}
